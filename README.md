## Objective  

This project focuses on analyzing the lift characteristics of a NACA 4412 airfoil under varying flow conditions. The primary objectives include:  

- Measuring lift force at different angles of attack and freestream velocities.  
- Calculating the lift coefficient (Cl) for each test condition.  
- Comparing experimental results with theoretical and computational predictions.  
- Conducting an uncertainty analysis on the measured data (lift, velocity, and angle of attack).  

ðŸ“„ The complete methodology, results, and discussion are available in the **[Project Report PDF](./Project_Report.pdf)**.
